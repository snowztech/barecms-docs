## ðŸŽ¯ Key Concepts

### Sites

A **Site** is a container for your content. Think of it as your project or website.

### Collections

**Collections** are groups of similar content within a site (e.g., "Posts", "Pages", "Products").

### Entries

**Entries** are individual pieces of content within a collection (e.g., a blog post, a page, a product).

### Public Data API

The **Public Data API** (`GET /:siteSlug/data`) provides all your site's content without authentication - perfect for frontend consumption.

## ðŸ”§ Core Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Create Site] --> B[Add Collections]
    B --> C[Create Entries]
    C --> D[Access via Public API]
    D --> E[Build Your Frontend]
```

1. **Create a Site** - Your content container
2. **Add Collections** - Group related content
3. **Create Entries** - Add your actual content
4. **Access via Public API** - Fetch data for your frontend
5. **Build Your Frontend** - Use any framework you like
